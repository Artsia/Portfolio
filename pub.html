                    DESCRIPTION: People spend thousands of dollars each year in Canada on basic repairs.
                    Most of these repairs can be done by anyone if they are informed. A mechanical background is not
                    necessary to fix car headlights.
                    Therefore, I propose a solution for owners of the 2011 ford fiesta.
                    I will provide an easy-to-follow guide on how to replace the passenger front side headlights.
                    The purpose of this guide is to encourage people to fix their cars.
                    Having access to this guide will save them money. Although saving money may be the main factor in
                    using this guide,
                    I hope that the user of this guide will take with them knowledge and a boost of confidence because
                    they have learned something new.
